# Logging Sinks demo

This project demonstrates the Sinks API for logging.

The [Logging docs](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/logging/) explains some of the code in this sample.

### Running this sample

1. Make sure Temporal Server is running locally (see the [quick install guide](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/quick-install/)).
1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. `npm run start.watch` to start the Worker.
1. In another shell, `npm run workflow` to run the Workflow.

Example output:

```
Hello, Temporal!
```
