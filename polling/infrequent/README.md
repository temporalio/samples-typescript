# Infrequently Polling Activity

This sample shows how we can implement infrequent polling (1 second or faster) inside our Activity. The implementation is a loop that polls our service and then sleeps for the poll interval (1 second in the sample).

To ensure that polling Activity is restarted in a timely manner, we make sure that it heartbeats on every iteration. Note that heartbeating only works if we set the `heartbeat_timeout` to a shorter value than the Activity `start_to_close_timeout` timeout.

To run, first see [README.md](../../README.md) for prerequisites.

The Workflow will continue to poll the service and heartbeat on every iteration until it succeeds.

Note that with infrequent polling, the Activity may execute for a long time, and it may be beneficial to set a Timeout on the Activity to avoid long-running Activities that are not heartbeating.

If the polling interval needs to be changed during runtime, the Activity needs to be canceled and a new instance with the updated arguments needs to be started.

### Testing

- Jest: `npm run test`:
  - [`src/test/workflows.test.ts`](./src/test/workflows.test.ts)

### Running this sample

1. `temporal server start-dev` to start [Temporal Server](https://github.com/temporalio/cli/#installation).
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. `npm run start.watch` to start the Worker.
4. In another shell, `npm run workflow` to run the Workflow Client.
